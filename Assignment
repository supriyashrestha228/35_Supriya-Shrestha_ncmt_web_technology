Chapter 1:AN OVERVIEW OF THE INTERNET AND THE WEB
Group A Short Question
1. Define the term “Protocol” in the context of the Internet.
A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over the Internet, ensuring proper communication between devices.

2. What is the primary difference between a Web Browser and a Search Engine?
A web browser is software used to access and view websites (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), while a search engine is a service that helps users find websites on the Internet.

3. Define the World Wide Web (WWW).
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of interlinked web pages and resources accessed over the Internet using web browsers and HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

4. Distinguish between a static web page and a dynamic web page.
A static web page shows the same content each time they are viewed. Dynamic pages have content that can change each time they are accessed.

Group B: Long Questions 
5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
In client-server architecture, the client (browser) requests data, and the server processes the request and sends back a response.
•	Client sends request (URL)
•	Server processes request
•	Server sends response (HTML/CSS/data)

6. Describe the functions of Email, FTP, and VoIP.
•	Email: Used to send and receive electronic messages and attachments.
•	FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used to upload and download files between computers over the Internet.
•	VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol): Enables voice and video calls over the Internet (e.g., Zoom, Skype).

7. “The Internet is a network of networks.” Explain with packet switching.
•	The Internet connects many smaller networks worldwide. Data is broken into packets, each travelling independently through different routes. At the destination, packets are reassembled, ensuring fast and reliable data transmission.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
8. Static vs Dynamic website for a startup
I would not agree with using a dynamic website because,
•	Same content for all users
•	Low maintenance required
•	Cheaper hosting
•	Faster loading
A static website is more suitable and cost-effective for this requirement.

9. Diagnose “Server Not Found” error
The problem is a DNS failure.
•	Domain name (www.google.com) must be translated into an IP address
•	DNS server failed to resolve the name
•	Direct IP access works, confirming server availability
Thus, the DNS system failed.

10. Choosing the correct network type
The company should use an Extranet because,
•	Allows limited access to external suppliers
•	Secures sensitive data
•	Not accessible to the general public
An extranet provides controlled data sharing beyond the organisation.
