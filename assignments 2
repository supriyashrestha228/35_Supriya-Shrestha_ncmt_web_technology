CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCES
Group A Short Question
1. Define the term “Sitemap” in the planning phase.
A sitemap is a visual or structured representation of all the pages of a website and their relationships. It helps to plan website navigation and content hierarchy before development begins.
2. What is the purpose of the “Launch” phase in web development?
The Launch phase involves making the website live for public use after final testing, configuration, and deployment on a web server.
3. Why is “Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
Documentation is important because it provides clear records of system design, functionality, and maintenance procedures, making future updates, troubleshooting, and team collaboration easier.

4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
Front-end Development	Back-end Development
Focuses on the user interface	Focuses on server-side logic
Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript	Uses PHP, Python, Java, and databases
Runs in the browser	Runs on the server

Group B: Long Questions (4 Marks)
5. “Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement.
Planning is the most critical phase because it lays the foundation for the entire project. Key activities include:
•	Defining project goals and objectives
•	Identifying target audience and user requirements
•	Creating sitemap and wireframes
•	Choosing technologies and platforms
•	Estimating budget, timeline, and resources
Proper planning reduces errors, saves time, and ensures the project meets client expectations.

6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly “finished”?
The Maintenance phase is iterative because it involves continuous updates such as fixing bugs, updating content, improving security, and adding new features.
A website is never truly “finished” because user needs, technology, and content constantly change, requiring ongoing improvements.

7. Describe the process of “Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial?
Information Gathering involves collecting details about client requirements, business goals, competitors, content needs, and target users through interviews, surveys, and research.
Understanding the target audience is crucial because it helps design a website that matches users’ preferences, behaviour, and expectations, improving usability and engagement.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
8. Persuasive argument against skipping the Testing phase
Skipping the Testing phase can cause serious risks:
•	Security risks: Vulnerabilities may expose customer data and payment details.
•	Functionality issues: Broken links, payment failures, or checkout errors can occur.
•	Compatibility problems: The site may not work properly on different browsers or devices.
Testing ensures reliability, customer trust, and long-term cost savings by preventing expensive fixes after launch.

9. Analyse what went wrong when coding began without design or sitemap
The problem occurred due to a lack of proper planning. The developer skipped creating a sitemap and design prototype, leading to misunderstandings about layout and structure.
This should have been handled by:
•	Creating wireframes and sitemap
•	Getting client approval before coding
•	Following a structured development process
This approach prevents rework and saves time and resources.

10. Neglected phase in the university website scenario
The neglected phase is the Maintenance phase.
Activities involved in this phase include:
•	Updating content regularly
•	Fixing errors and broken links
•	Monitoring performance and usability
•	Ensuring information remains accurate
Failure to maintain the website resulted in outdated exam schedules, causing users to stop visiting.
