CHAPTER 3: WEB STRUCTURE DESIGN
Group A Short Question
1. Define Information Architecture (IA).
Information Architecture (IA) is the process of organising, structuring, and labelling content on a website so users can easily find information and navigate efficiently.
2. What is a “Wireframe”?
A wireframe is a basic visual blueprint of a web page that shows layout, content placement, and navigation structure without colours, images, or styling.
3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
Cognitive Friction refers to the mental effort required by users when a website is confusing, cluttered, or difficult to understand, causing frustration and poor user experience.
4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
Hyphens are treated as word separators by search engines, improving readability and SEO, whereas underscores join words together and reduce clarity.
5. Compare Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure.
Aspect	Hierarchical Structure	Linear Structure
Organization	Parent–child relationship	Step-by-step order
Navigation	Multiple paths	Single path
Complexity	Suitable for large sites	Suitable for small sites
Example	University website	Online tutorial
Usage Example:
•	Hierarchical: University → Departments → Courses
•	Linear: Online exam → Instructions → Questions → Submit

6. Explain the “Three-Click Rule” and its significance.
The Three-Click Rule states that users should reach any information on a website within three clicks.
Significance:
•	Improves usability
•	Reduces frustration
•	Encourages users to stay longer

7. PLAN BEFORE YOU DO EXPLAIN HOW TOOLS LIKE CARD SORTING AND FLOWCHARTS HELP IN PLANNNIG
Plan before you do” means properly organising and structuring a website before starting design and development. Tools like Card Sorting and Flowcharts play an important role in this planning stage.
Card Sorting is a technique where content items are written on cards and grouped based on how users think they should be organized. It helps designers understand user expectations, create logical categories, and design clear navigation menus. This reduces confusion and improves usability.
Flowcharts visually represent the movement of users from one page to another. They show navigation paths, decision points, and page relationships. Flowcharts help identify errors, missing links, and unnecessary steps before development begins.
Together, Card Sorting and Flowcharts ensure a well-structured, user-friendly, and efficient website, saving time, cost, and redesign effort later.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)
. University Website – Structural Model Selection
For a University website with hundreds of pages such as Admissions, Departments, Alumni, and News, the most suitable structural model is the Hierarchical (Tree) Structure.
Justification:
•	It organizes large amounts of information logically
•	Allows users to navigate from general to specific content
•	Easy to scale when new departments or pages are added
•	Improves usability and findability
Rough Diagram:
Home
 ├── Admissions
 │     ├── Undergraduate
 │     ├── Postgraduate
 ├── Departments
 │     ├── Science
 │     ├── Management
 ├── Alumni
 └── News
This structure ensures smooth navigation and efficient content management.

9. Navigation Hidden Behind Icon – KISS Principle Analysis
This design fails to follow the KISS (Keep It Simple) principle. On desktop screens, hiding the navigation menu behind a small icon increases cognitive load and confuses users.
Problems:
•	Navigation is not immediately visible
•	Users struggle to find essential links
•	Causes frustration and quick exit (high bounce rate)
Conclusion:
Navigation menus should be clearly visible on desktop devices. Simplicity and clarity are key to good user experience.

10. Poor URL Structure – User & SEO Issues
The URL
www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9
is bad for both users and search engines.
Problems:
•	Not readable or memorable
•	Gives no idea about page content
•	Difficult for search engines to index
•	Poor SEO performance
Improved URL using Page Slugs:
www.shop.com/electronics/mobile-phones
Benefits:
•	User-friendly and meaningful
•	SEO optimized
•	Easy to share and understand
Using descriptive page slugs improves both usability and search ranking.
CHAPTER 4: WEBSITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
1. Differentiate between Legibility and Readability
•	Legibility refers to how easily individual characters or letters can be recognized.
•	Readability refers to how easily blocks of text can be read and understood.

2. What is the “Rule of Thirds” in layout design?
The Rule of Thirds divides a page into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines, helping designers place important elements at visually balanced points.

3. Why should you limit the number of font families on a website?
Limiting font families:
•	Maintains visual consistency
•	Improves readability
•	Reduces visual clutter
•	Enhances professional appearance

4. Define “Responsive Web Design.”
Responsive Web Design is an approach where a website automatically adapts its layout and content to fit different screen sizes and devices such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops.
5. Explain the “F-Pattern” of scanning and its influence on content placement
The F-Pattern describes how users typically scan a web page rather than read it word by word. Eye-tracking studies show that users first scan horizontally across the top, then move slightly down and scan again, and finally scan vertically along the left side, forming an “F” shape.
Influence on content placement:
•	Important information should be placed at the top of the page
•	Headings and keywords should be left-aligned
•	Navigation menus work best at the top or left
•	Key messages and call-to-action elements should appear early
Designing according to the F-Pattern improves readability and user engagement.

6. Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design with examples
Colors strongly affect user emotions, behavior, and perception of a website.
•	Blue: Represents trust, calmness, and professionalism. Commonly used in banking, corporate, and technology websites.
•	Red: Conveys energy, urgency, and excitement. Often used for sale banners, alerts, and call-to-action buttons.
•	Green: Symbolizes growth, health, and nature. Ideal for environmental, healthcare, and finance websites.
Choosing appropriate colors helps build trust, guide user actions, and strengthen brand identity.

7. Explain the “60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance
The 60-30-10 Rule is a design guideline used to create visual harmony through balanced color distribution.
•	60% – Primary color (background or main sections)
•	30% – Secondary color (supporting areas or sections)
•	10% – Accent color (buttons, links, highlights)
This rule prevents visual clutter, maintains consistency, and draws attention to important elements, improving overall user experience.
8. Slow Website Due to High-Resolution Images – Image Optimization
Using high-resolution raw images directly from a camera increases page size, causing slow loading and higher bounce rates. Image Optimization is essential to improve website performance and user experience.
Importance of Image Optimization:
•	Reduces file size without noticeable quality loss
•	Improves page loading speed
•	Saves bandwidth and improves SEO
•	Enhances user satisfaction
JPEG vs PNG:
•	JPEG: Best for photographs; uses lossy compression and smaller file size
•	PNG: Best for logos and images needing transparency; larger file size
Solution:
Resize images to required dimensions, compress them, and use JPEG for photos and PNG only where transparency is needed.

9. Law Firm Website – Color and Typography Critique
Using a bright yellow background with Comic Sans font violates principles of Color Theory and Typography.
Problems:
•	Yellow causes eye strain and lacks professionalism
•	Comic Sans appears informal and untrustworthy
•	Does not match the serious nature of a law firm
Better Alternative:
•	Use professional colors like blue, dark grey, or white
•	Choose fonts like Serif (Times New Roman) or Sans-serif (Roboto, Open Sans)
•	Maintain contrast and consistency
This creates a trustworthy, credible, and professional appearance.

10. Poor Mobile Experience – Missing Design Principle
The missing design principle is Responsive Web Design.
Problems:
•	Fixed-width layout
•	No mobile optimization
•	Poor readability and usability
Solution using Media Queries and Fluid Grids:
•	Media Queries adjust layout based on screen size
•	Fluid Grids use relative units instead of fixed pixels
•	Content adapts automatically to mobile screens
This ensures the website is readable and usable on all devices, improving user experience.
